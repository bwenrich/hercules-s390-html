        Apple development tools.  
        Either of the following will do.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Xcode Interactive Development Environment (IDE).  
                Note that the IDE package includes and installs the Xcode Command Line Tools.  
                Available in the macOS App Store.  
                To see if the full Xcode package is installed, 
                do the following in the terminal app: <code>xcode-select -p</code> 
                and look for a response of 
                <code>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                The Xcode Command Line Tools.  
                To see if the Xcode Command Line Tools are installed, 
                do the following in the terminal app: <code>gcc --version</code>.
                If the tools are not installed, 
                a dialog box will appear offering to install them.  
                You can also install them from the 
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple Developer</a> site. 
                A paid developer account is not required to obtain the 
                Xcode command line tools.  
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
         <a href="http://cmake.org/download" target="_blank">CMake </a>
         version 3.4 or better: <code>cmake&nbsp;--version</code>.

        A <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">macOS git command line client</a> 
        version 1.8.5.1 or better; use <code>git&nbsp;--version</code>.
        Note: the Xcode command line tools include a git client.  
        Xcode 9.2, the current version,
        includes 2.14.3.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Optional: The 
        <a href="https://ninja-build.org/" target="_blank">
        Ninja build tool</a>, a replacement for GNU make.  
        Ninja will build Hercules a bit faster than GNU make.

        extracted and moved to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        (Optional but desireable): Either of the following REXX interpreters.  
        A REXX interpreter is needed if you wish to run the Hercules test cases using
        CTest, runtest.rexx, and/or the RUN_TESTS project from
        within Xcode.
        REXX must alse be installed if you wish to use REXX
        in Hercules scripts.

    Should you experience difficulties using CMake to

    and use the 
    <a href="../hercinst.html">Installation Using Legacy Tools</a>
    below to build Hercules.  
</p>

<h4 class="skiplogo" id="buildide">Build using the Xcode IDE</h4>
<p>
    Begin by following steps one through four above.  
    Be sure you use -G "Xcode" in Step four. 
</p>

<ol start="6">
    <li class="spaced">Open the Xcode application</li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Open the Xcode project created by the CMake configure step: 
        navigate to the build directory and open Hercules.Xcodeproj.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Xcode by default builds for "Testing," 
        which corresponds to a CMake Debug configuration.  
        Change this if desired: Product, Build For, Release.
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Build the solution: Product, Build.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        When the build has completed, 
        you may run the Hercules tests by building 
        the RUN_TESTS scheme: Product, Scheme, RUN_TEST, 
        followed by Product, Build.
    </li>
</ol>


<h4 class="skiplogo" id="install">Installing and Uninstalling Hercules</h4>
<p>
    Hercules may be installed using a command line or using 
    the Xcode IDE.  
</p>
<p>
    While it is possible to start the Xcode IDE with 
    administrative privileges and use it to install,
    the command prompt is the recommended approach.  
</p>
<p>
    The CMake configure option -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX can be used
    to change the default installation directory. 
</p>

<h5>Installing Hercules</h5>
<ol>
    <li class="spaced">
        Open a command prompt.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Navigate to the build directory.
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Issue the following command.  Use <code>sudo</code> if needed.
        <p>
            <code>cmake -P cmake_install.cmake</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to install Hercules in a directory other
            than the one that was used in the CMake configure
            step, 
            say, for example /home/userid/hercules,
            you can override that directory with the following 
            form of the install command:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/home/userid/hercules" -P cmake_install.cmake</code>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>


<h5>Uninstalling Hercules</h5>
<p>
    Uninstallation can be easily performed by deleting the installation directory.  
</p>
<p>
    If you have installed Hercules in a subdirectory that contains other 
    applications, files, or data, 
    you can use the following steps to remove <em>just</em> the Hercules files.
</p>
<p>
    This procedure removes Hercules file by file from its last installed 
    location.  
    It uses a manifest of full path names that is re-created in the 
    build directory on each install of Hercules.  
    So if you install to the wrong location and then install to the right
    location, 
    this procedure will remove Hercules from the right location.  
</p>
<ol>
    <li class="spaced">
        Open a command prompt.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Navigate to the build directory.
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Issue the following command.  Use <code>sudo</code> if needed.
        <p>
            <code>cmake -P cmake_uninstall.cmake</code>
        </p>

<h3 class="skiplogo" id="whycmake">Why should I use CMake to build Hercules for macOS?</h3>

<ul>
    <li class="spaced">
        The CMake scripts will automatically build SoftFloat-3a, 
        and if the versions of BZip2 and Zlib 
        are older than the versions in the Hercules-390 project,
        those packages as well.
        These packages are built in a subdirectory of
        the build directory.
        Options are provided to build these packages in another directory,
        to share one package build directory with
        multiple CMake Hercules build directories,
        or to use previously-built packages.
    </li>
    <li>
        Hercules will be built to use macOS shared libraries (.dylib)
        and dynamically loaded libraries (.so).
        When built using the legacy <code>configure.ac</code> script,
        Hercules is built as a single statically-linked executeable 
        with no support for cryptographic instructions.
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        The CMake scripts for Hercules are the same for 
        UNIX-like, macOS, and Windows systems.
        The same options are used when building Hercules 
        on any of those systems.  
        See the 
        <a href="buildopts.html">Alphabetical List of CMake Hercules Build Command-Line Options</a>
        for more information about Hercules-specific options 
        that can control the build when using CMake. 
        See 
        <a href="cmakeopts.html">Standard CMake Build Options</a>
        for more information about general CMake options 
        that can be useful when building Hercules. 
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">The Hercules source directory is not altered when you build Hercules.  
        All files created or changed by the build are stored in a separate 
        build directory, 
        as is the case when one builds Hercules on a UNIX-like system. 
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        You can build in any directory that is not the Hercules source
        directory.  
        There is no specific directory structure requirement, 
        nor any required relationship between the build directory 
        and the source directory.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        A corollary of the above is that you can build multiple copies of 
        Hercules with different build options,
        say, different versions of external packages,
        without having to clone Hercules multiple times
        into separate source directories.  
        This should simplify local clone management for
        Windows developers.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        You can develop and build using the Integrated Development Environment
        provided by Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition or 
        Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
        Older versions are supported by CMake,
        but the Hercules CMake build has not been tested.  
        Note that building Hercules with Visual Studio versions 
        older than 2008 is not supported by Hercules regardless of the
        build tool in use.   
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        A target RUN_TESTS is created to allow running the complete runtest 
        suite from within the Xcode IDE.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        You can build Hercules from a command line using either GNU Make or Ninja.
        GNU Make is a component of the Xcode Command Line Tools.

<h4 class="skiplogo" id="extpkgs">External Package Incompatibilities (BZip2, PCRE, Zlib)</h4>

<p>
    When building Hercules using CMake on Windows, 
    the external packages BZip2, PCRE, and Zlib
    will normally be built 
    at the same time and in the Hercules build directory
    from github repositories that are part of the Hercules-390 project.  
    DLLs for these applications will be installed as 
    part of Hercules in the Hercules installation
    directory.
</p>
<p>
    Older pre-built versions of these external packages cannot
    be used when building Hercules on Windows using CMake.
    This applies to versions of these packages built from 
    other sources or libraries installed
    from Zip archives found in sundry locations on the web
    (including the binaries included in 
    <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/hyperion/releases/tag/4.0.0-rc0">
        Hercules 4.0 Release Candidate 0
        </a>).  
</p>
<p>
    The Hercules-390 repositories for the BZip2, PCRE, and Zlib
    cannot be used to build packages for the makefile.bat build because
    the directory structures differ from that required for 
    makefile.bat. 
</p>
<p>
    The sources for these packages in the Hercules-390 project
    are at the latest release, 
    incorporate corrections and security updates not found in 
    binaries available in other locations, 
    and are otherwise unmodified from the originals.
    They are used subject to the terms of their original licenses,
    which are included in the repositories.
