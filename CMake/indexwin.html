<p>
    Should you experience difficulties using CMake to 
    build Hercules
    please follow the guidance provided in 
    <a href="#What_To_Do_When_it_Fails">What To Do When it Fails</a>
    and use the 
    <a href="../hercinst.html">Installation Using Legacy Tools</a>
    below to build Hercules.  
</p>

<h4 class="skiplogo" id="buildide">Build using the Visual Studio IDE</h4>
<p>
Begin by following steps 1-5 above.  
Be sure you select a &lt;generator name&gt; 
that corresponds to the version of Visual Studio you plan to use.  
Note that you cannot use the command line generators with Visual Studio.  
</p>

<ol start="6">
    <li class="spaced">Open the Visual Studio application</li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Open the solution created by the CMake configure step: File, Open, Project/Solution.  
        Navigate to the build directory and open Hercules.sln.  
    </li>
    <p>
        <strong>Note: </strong>If you see files named Hercules_VS*.sln, 
        check to make sure you did not navigate to the source 
        directory by mischance.  
    </p>
    <li class="spaced">
        Visual Studio by default offers the alphabetically first 
        configuration, Debug.  
        Use the drop-down on the line below the menu bar to
        change this to Release.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Using the menu bar, build the solution: Build, Build Solution.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        When the build has completed, 
        you may run the Hercules tests by scrolling to the 
        project RUN_TESTS in the Solucion Explorer on the right-hand
        side of the Visual Studio application window,
        right-mouse clicking on it, and selecting Build.  
    </li>
</ol>


<h4 class="skiplogo" id="install">Installing and Uninstalling Hercules</h4>
<p>
    Hercules may be installed using a command prompt or using 
    the Visual Studio IDE.  
    The command prompt may be but does not need to be a 
    Visual Studio command prompt.  
    If you wish to install Hercules in a system location, 
    including the default location of C:\Program Files\Hercules,
    you should use a standard command prompt with administrative 
    privileges.  
</p>
<p>
    The CMake configure option -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX can be used
    to change the default installation directory. 
    It is recommended to install Hercules in a separate subdirectory
    when installing in Windows.  
</p>
<p>
    While it is possible to start Visual Studio with 
    administrative privileges and use it to install,
    the command prompt is the recommended approach.  
</p>

<h5>Installing Hercules</h5>
<ol>
    <li class="spaced">
        Open a command prompt.  
        If you are installing to a system location, 
        open a command prompt with administrative privileges.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Navigate to the build directory.
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Issue the following command:
        <p>
            <code>cmake -P cmake_install.cmake</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to install Hercules in a directory other
            than the one that was used in the CMake configure
            step, 
            say, for example %userprofile%\hercules,
            you can override that directory with the following 
            form of the install command:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="%userprofile%\hercules" -P cmake_install.cmake</code>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>


<h5>Uninstalling Hercules</h5>
<p>
    Uninstallation can be easily performed by deleting the installation directory.  
    All Hercules components and external packages are by default installed in a 
    separate directory in C:\Program Files.  
</p>
<p>
    If you have installed Hercules in a subdirectory that contains other 
    applications, files, or data, 
    you can use the following steps to remove <em>just</em> the Hercules files.
</p>
<p>
    This procedure removes Hercules file by file from its last installed 
    location.  
    It uses a manifest of full path names that is re-created in the 
    build directory on each install of Hercules.  
    So if you install to the wrong location and then install to the right
    location, 
    this procedure will remove Hercules from the right location.  
</p>
<ol>
    <li class="spaced">
        Open a command prompt.  
        If you previously installed Hercules to a system location, 
        open a command prompt with administrative privileges.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Navigate to the build directory.
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        Issue the following command:
        <p>
            <code>cmake -P cmake_uninstall.cmake</code>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="skiplogo" id="whycmake">Why should I use CMake to build Hercules for Windows?</h3>

<ul>
    <li class="spaced">
        The CMake scripts will automatically build the following required packages:
        BZip2, PCRE, SoftFloat-3a, and Zlib.  
        These packages are built in a subdirectory of
        the build directory.
        You do not need to locate installable versions of these packages and set up
        Windows environment variables to point to their respective Installation directories.  
        Options are provided to build these packages in another directory,
        to share one package build directory with
        multiple CMake Hercules build directories,
        or to use previously-built packages.
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        An installation script is created to install Hercules 
        in the correct Program Files directory
        or the directory you specify in <code>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>.  
        This script requires an administrative command prompt if you wish to install 
        Hercules in a directory protected by Windows.  
        The default Windows installation directory is 
        c:\Program Files (x86)\Hercules 
        when a 32-bit Hercules-390 is built on a 64-bit system, 
        and c:\Program Files\Hercules otherwise.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        The build recognizes changes in header files as requiring recompilation of the files
        that use the altered headers.  
        This is consistent with the CMake and GNU Autotools build scripts on UNIX-like systems
        and a significant improvement over the makefile.bat-based Windows build, 
        which did no header dependency checking.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        The CMake scripts for Hercules are the same
        for both UNIX-like and Windows builds and 
        use the same options 
        as when building Hercules on UNIX-like systems.  
        See the 
        <a href="buildopts.html">Alphabetical List of CMake Hercules Build Command-Line Options</a>
        for more information about Hercules-specific options 
        that can control the build when using CMake. 
        See 
        <a href="cmakeopts.html">Standard CMake Build Options</a>
        for more information about general CMake options 
        that can be useful when building Hercules. 


    </li>
    <li class="spaced">The Hercules source directory is not altered when you build Hercules.  
        All files created or changed by the build are stored in a separate 
        build directory, 
        as is the case when one builds Hercules on a UNIX-like system. 
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        You can build in any directory that is not the Hercules source
        directory.  
        There is no specific directory structure requirement, 
        nor any required relationship between the build directory 
        and the source directory.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        A corollary of the above is that you can build multiple copies of 
        Hercules with different build options,
        say, different versions of external packages,
        without having to clone Hercules multiple times
        into separate source directories.  
        This should simplify local clone management for
        Windows developers.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        You can develop and build using the Integrated Development Environment
        provided by Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition or 
        Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
        Older versions are supported by CMake,
        but the Hercules CMake build has not been tested.  
        Note that building Hercules with Visual Studio versions 
        older than 2008 is not supported by Hercules regardless of the
        build tool in use.   
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        A target RUN_TESTS is created to allow running the complete runtest 
        suite from within the Visual Studio IDE.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        You can build Hercules from a command line using either MSBuild or NMake.
        NMake is a component of Visual Studio and is included in all versions that 
        may be used to build Hercules (2008 or newer).
        MSBuild, formerly a component of the .NET Framework, 
        is included with Visual Studio 2013 and newer versions, 
        including the Build Tools versions.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        CMake supports JOM, a replacement for NMake that 
        supports parallel operations when building Hercules.
        JOM provides a capability similar to /maxcpucount: on a
        command-line build using MSBuild.exe.  
    </li>
    <li class="spaced">
        The legacy script win32.mak is not required for command-line or IDE-based builds.  
        The script win32.mak was removed by Microsoft from newer versions of 
        Visual Studio.

<h3 class="skiplogo" id="versusmakefile">Changes From the makefile.bat Build</h3>
<p>
    Before the CMake scripts, 
    Hercules was built using makefile.bat.
    The command makefile.bat was used whether one built from a command prompt 
    or using the Visual Studio IDE.  
    Internally, makefile.bat used NMake, 
    an older Microsoft build tool, 
    and required win32.mak.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="spaced">
        The makefile.bat command line options are no longer used.
        All are replaced by CMake build options.
        See the table below to match old makefile.bat options to
        the corresponding CMake options.  
    </li>

    <li class="spaced">
        Pre-compiled headers are not created nor used.
        The CMake build will exploit multiple processor cores, 
        and this improves performance of the build without the 
        complexity of pre-compiled headers.  
    </li>

    <li class="spaced">
        Visual Studio solutions created by CMake do not support 32-bit and
        64-bit builds in the same project.  
        Instead, use two build directories, 
        one for a 32-bit solution and one for a 64-bit solution.  
    </li>

    <li class="spaced">
        Detailed test results from make test are not displayed on the console.
        Instead, detailed results for each test group are saved in files in the
        <code>&lt;build-dir&gt;/Testing/Temporary</code> directory.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="skiplogo" id="optcomp">Comparison of makefile.bat and CMake Options (table)</h4>

here is a synopsis of the makefile.bat command:

<h4 class="skiplogo" id="extpkgs">External Package Incompatibilities (BZip2, PCRE, Zlib)</h4>

<p>
    When building Hercules using CMake on Windows, 
    the external packages BZip2, PCRE, and Zlib
    will normally be built 
    at the same time and in the Hercules build directory
    from github repositories that are part of the Hercules-390 project.  
    DLLs for these applications will be installed as 
    part of Hercules in the Hercules installation
    directory.
</p>
<p>
    Older pre-built versions of these external packages cannot
    be used when building Hercules on Windows using CMake.
    This applies to versions of these packages built from 
    other sources or libraries installed
    from Zip archives found in sundry locations on the web
    (including the binaries included in 
    <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/hyperion/releases/tag/4.0.0-rc0">
        Hercules 4.0 Release Candidate 0
        </a>).  
</p>
<p>
    The Hercules-390 repositories for the BZip2, PCRE, and Zlib
    cannot be used to build packages for the makefile.bat build because
    the directory structures differ from that required for 
    makefile.bat. 
</p>
<p>
    The sources for these packages in the Hercules-390 project
    are at the latest release, 
    incorporate corrections and security updates not found in 
    binaries available in other locations, 
    and are otherwise unmodified from the originals.
    They are used subject to the terms of their original licenses,
    which are included in the repositories.  
</p>
<p>
    For additional information about the Hercules-specific builds 
    for these packages, please see the repositories for the packages at:
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="spaced">BZip2 1.0.6: <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/h390BZip" target="_blank">https://github.com/hercules-390/h390BZip</a></li>
    <li class="spaced">PCRE 8.41: <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/h390PCRE" target="_blank">https://github.com/hercules-390/h390PCRE</a></li>
    <li class="spaced">Zlib 1.2.11: <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/h390Zlib" target="_blank">https://github.com/hercules-390/h390Zlib</a></li>
</ul>


<h4 class="skiplogo" id="envvars">Environment Variable Incompatibilities</h4>

<p>
    Three environment variables are used by the makefile.bat build and by 
    the CMake build for Hercules on Windows that creates a compatibility issue.  
    The three environment variables are:
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <li class="spaced"><code>bzip2_dir</code></li>
        <li class="spaced"><code>pcre_dir</code></li>
        <li class="spaced"><code>zlib_dir</code></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Note that Windows environment variables are case-insensitive.  
</p>
<p>
    Both the makefile.bat and CMake builds for Hercules allows these variables
    to point to directories containing the respective packages.
    But because CMake requires a different directory layout from that used
    by makefile.bat, 
    one cannot use the same directory for both makefile.bat and CMake builds.  
</p>
<p>
    If makefile.bat finds these variables un-set, 
    it looks for the BZip2, PCRE, and Zlib packages in a 
    "winbuild" directory tree at the same level as the 
    Hyperion source directory.  
    If makefile.bat does not find the packages in that
    default location, 
    the capabilities avaiable in the packages are excluded 
    from Hercules.  
</p>
<p>
    If the CMake build for Hercules finds these variables un-set,
    it clones each of the three packages from repositories in the
    Hercules-390 project, builds the packages in a subdirectory
    of the Hercules build tree, 
    and uses those the newly-built packages when 
    building Hercules.  
</p>
<p>
    The recommendation is to un-set the variables, 
    and you will find this recommendation included in the 
    <a href="#quickstart">QUICK START</a> 
    section above.  
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to preserve the ability to build 
    Hercules using makefiles.bat, 
    move the directories for the legacy versions 
    of BZip2, PCRE, and Zlib into a winbuild 
    directory at the same level as the Hercules-390
    source directory.  
    Alternatively, you may install all three 
    packages in the needed winbuild structure 
    using the 
    <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/hyperion/releases/download/4.0.0-rc0/WinSup4H.exe">
        Windows Support Files link</a> 
    (downloads an exe) included with 
    <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/hyperion/releases/tag/4.0.0-rc0">
        Hercules 4.0 Release Candidate 0</a>.
</p>

<h4 class="skiplogo" id="buildtreedelta">Build Tree Differences</h4>

<p>
    The build tree created by a Hercules build using CMake is 
    substantially different from that created by the 
    makefiles.bat build.  
</p>
<p>
    The makefile.bat build creates a set of five or six subdirectories
    in the source tree, 
    with one set created for 32-bit Hercules
    and a second set for 64-bit Hercules.
    Each directory holds one type of build result: 
    generated include files,
    object files,
    linkage editor maps,
    executables and DLLs,
    and debugging databases (program databases, or PDB files) for executable shared libraries.
    and optionally assembly listings.  
    A single consolidated compilation program database (PDB) 
    is created in the object directory.
</p>
<p>
    Note: the single compilation program database is 
    only possible because makefile.bat only allows
    for single-threaded compilations.  
</p>
<p>
    When CMake is used to create the build scripts for Hercules,
    a subdirectory is created for each executable and DLL that will be built.  
    All object modules, assembler listings, 
    and source program databases are created in this subdirectory. 
    If Visual Studio or MSBuild is used to build Hercules,
    then these components are stored in a Release or Debug
    subdirectory.  
    Executables, DLLs, linkage maps, linkage editor program databases, 
    DLL import libraries, and export files (.exp) are created in the 
    build directory
    (Release or Debug subdirectory if using Visual Studio or MSBuild).  
</p>



<h4 class="skiplogo" id="vssoldelta">Visual Studio Solution Differences</h4>

<p>
    Hercules has had a Visual Studio "solution" for Hercules since 
    a native Windows build was first developed in the late 2000's.  
    This solution included a single project and enabled two things:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
    <li class="spaced">Source file editing using Visual Studio</li>
    <li class="spaced">Execution of the makefile.bat build script</li>
</ol>
<p>
    All source files were children of the single project. 
    There is no connection between the source files,
    the header files they require, 
    or the executables and DLLs that they end up creating.  
</p>
<p>
When CMake is used to configure and build Hercules,
it creates a separate Visual Studio solution in the 
build directory.  
This solution includes one project per executable, 
DLL (shared library), or external package.  
Additional projects are created to run tests (RUN_TESTS)
and to ensure that if the CMake scripts change, 
they are re-run before Hercules is built.
</p>
<p>
This solution can be used to build Hercules
using the Visual Studio application or 
using a Visual Studio command prompt with MSBuild.
It can also be used to edit files in the source directory.
</p>
