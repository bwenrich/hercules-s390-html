<h3 id="quickstart">QUICK START: Build Hercules Using CMake</h3>
<p>To build Hercules on your computer using CMake,
you need the following software installed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    CMake version 3.4 or better: <code>cmake&nbsp;--version</code>.  
    (CMake older than 3.4?  
    <a href="upgrcmake.html" target="_blank">See these instructions</a>.)
</li>
<li>A git client version 1.8.5.1 or better: <code>git&nbsp;--version</code>.</li>
<li>A c compiler.  Both gcc and clang have been tested.</li>
<li>If you wish to use <code>1Stop-Cmake</code>, sed.</li>
<li>A REXX interpreter,
    either Regina Rexx or Open Object Rexx,
    if you wish to run <code>make&thinsp;test</code>,
    the CMake equivalent of <code>make&thinsp;check</code>.&nbsp; 
</li>
<li>
    <em>Not required:</em> autoconf, automake, flex, gawk, grep, m4, nor perl.  
    Although there is no issue if these are installed on the
    system being used to build Hercules-390.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Do the following to build Hercules using CMake on GNU/Linux or BSD
open source systems or on Solaris.
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone or update your local clone of Hyperion, as needed.</li>

        <li>Create a build directory.  Anywhere you wish, so long as the
            directory is writable.</li>

        <li>cmake &lt;hyperion-source-dir&gt</li>

        <li>make</li>

        <li>make test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>not</em> make check)</li>

        <li>make install&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if you wish)</li>

    </ol>

<p>That's it.  SoftFloat-3a will be cloned and built inside the Hercules
build directory, and Hercules will be built.</p>

<h3 id="whycmake">Why should I use CMake to build Hercules?</h3>


<ul>
    <li>You can build in any directory that is not the Hercules source
        directory.  There is no specific directory structure requirement. </li>
    <li>There is no need to run autogen.sh in the source directory before
        building. </li>
    <li>The CMake build will take care of all SoftFloat-3a build
        requirements and will build SoftFloat-3a in a subdirectory of
        the build directory.
        Options are provided to build SoftFloat-3a in another directory,
        to share one SoftFloat-3a build directory with
        multiple CMake Hercules build directories,
        or to use a previously-built SoftFloat-3a.</li>
    <li>CMake supports either GNU make or BSD make.
        There is no need to install GNU make on a FreeBSD system. </li>
    <li>The CMake build supports Ninja, a replacement for make.</li>
    <li>There is no need to have GNU autotools installed on your building
        system.
        You just need git,
        CMake 3.4.3 or better,
        a build tool such as GNU Makefiles, BSD Makefiles, or Ninja,
        and gcc or clang.</li>
</ul>
<br />

<hr />
<h3 id="cmakestatus">CMake Build Development Status</h3>

<ul>

    <li>CMake may be used for Hercules open source system builds as an
    alternative to GNU autotools (autogen.sh followed by configure).
    </li>

    <li>The CMake build for Hercules has been tested on
    GNU/Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Leap),
    FreeBSD,
    Windows Subsystem For Linux,
    and Solaris.
    </li>

    <li>Apple build support has been coded but testing on macOS 10.10 Yosemite
    fails in the make command for Hercules;
    SoftFloat-3a builds successfully,
    and the CMake scripts complete without error.
    </li>

    <li>AIX builds have not been tested. </li>

    <li>Native (Visual Studio) Windows builds are not yet supported.
    That's comming.</li>
    <li>Apple macOS native Xcode builds have not been tested. </li>

</ul>
<br />
<hr />
<h3 id="versusautotools">Changes From the Autotools Build</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Libtool is not used.
    Shared libraries are always built.
        See below for the issue this creates with Open Object Rexx.</li>

    <li><code>-O3</code> is never included in automatic optimization flags.
    You may,
    if you wish,
    include <code>-O3</code> in either the
    <code>OPTIMIZATION</code> option or the
    <code>ADD-CFLAGS</code>
    option.
    </li>

    <li>A <code>make&thinsp;check</code> target is not generated.
        Use <code>make&thinsp;test</code> or <code>CTest</code> instead.</li>

    <li>Detailed test results from make test are not displayed on the console.
    Instead, detailed results for each test group are saved in files in the
    <code>&lt;build-dir&gt;/Testing/Temporary</code> directory.
    </li>

    <li>Ninja is supported as a generator and has been tested
    (multiple versions on multiple target systems).
    </li>
</ul>
<br />

<hr />
<h3 id="optdelta">Command Line Option Changes</h3>
<h4><code>--enable-xxx</code> is replaced with <code>-DXXX=yyy</code></h4>

<p>XXX is the configure.ac -enable option in caps.
</p>
<p>For example <code>--enable-ipv6</code>,
as a configure.ac command line option,
would be specified on the CMake command line as <code>-DIPV6=YES</code>;
code>--disable-ipv6</code> as <code>-DIPV6=NO</code>.
The <code>-D</code> prefix identifies a CMake command line option,
and what follows it is made available to CMake in much
the same way that -D is used by a c compiler.
</p>
<p>So these two command lines have the same effect on the Hercules build:
</p>
<table style="margin-left: 40px">
    <tr>
        <td>Autotools:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
        <td><code>configure --disable-largefile</code> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CMake:</td>
        <td><code>cmake -DLARGEFILE=NO</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>All command line options may be specified as environment variables.
Omit the -D when setting an environment variable.  The following two
lines set the same option for the CMake build:</p>

<table style="margin-left: 40px">
    <tr>
        <td><code>export SYNCIO=NO </code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>cmake -DSYNCIO=NO</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<h4><code>--help</code> is replaced with <code>-DHELP=YES</code></h4>
<p>To see all supported options, use:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><code>cmake &lt;source-dir&gt; -DHELP=YES</code>
</p>
<p>If you use <code>-DHELP=YES</code>, no build files are created.
</p>
<br />

<hr />
<h3 id="optnew">Command Line Option Additions</h3>
<h4><code>-DADD-CFLAGS</code></h4>
<p>If you need to set compiler options or define macros that are passed directly to the c compiler,
use <code>-DADD-CFLAGS="&lt;flags&gt;
"</code> where <code>&lt;flags&gt;</code> is replaced with the string of options and macros.
For example:
</p>
<p><code>cmake &lt;source-dir&gt; -DADD-CFLAGS="-DNO_ASM_BYTESWAP"</code>
</p>
<p>Compiler flags passed via <code>-DADD-CFLAGS=""</code> are appended to the flags
set up by CMake, which gives the builder the opportunity to turn off
things CMake may have turned on.
The default is a null string, which adds no additional c flags.
</p>

<h4><code>-DEXTPKG_DIR=&lt;path&gt;</code></h4>

<p>Defines an absolute or relative path of the top level directory to be
used for any external package that will be built by the Hercules build.
If a relative path, it is relative to the Hercules build directory.
If the path does not exist, it is created.
The relative directory <code>extpkg/</code> is used as a default.
</p>

<p>See <a href="extpkg.html">"Controlling the Automatic Build of External Packages"</a>
for more information.
</p>
<br />

<h3 id="limitations">Current Limitations of the CMake Build</h3>

<ul>
<li>No support for AIX builds.  Test subject needed.</li>
<li>No support for Windows builds. A Windows Build is the next goal.</li>
<li>No Support for Cygwin/MinGW. Formerly deprecated, now gone.</li>
<li>No support for creating an installation or source tarball.  Future activity.</li>
<li>No support for making hercifc setuid from within the build.
    You will have to do this manually.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ninjafreebsd">Ninja issues on FreeBSD</h4>
<p>
    As of this writing,
    the Ninja build tool cannot be used to build Hercules-390
    on FreeBSD. 
</p>
<p>
    Ninja on FreeBSD is unable to resolve the dependency of Hercules on the 
    SoftFloat-3a For Hercules static library.  
    Specific coding, a single option, 
    is required in the CMake script to use static libraries created by external projects,
    and this specific coding works on GNU/Linux target systems.  
    It is not clear whether this is a Ninja issue,
    a CMake issue,
    or an issue in the CMake scripts used to build Hercules-390.  
    Further investigation is needed. 
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, 
    use the CMake generator "UNIX Makefiles" when building
    Hercules-390 on FreeBSD.  
</p>


<h4 id="wslreginarexx">Windows Subsystem for Linux, Regina Rexx, and runtest.rexx</h4>
<p>
    As of this writing, 
    the runtest.rexx command, 
    used to run tests when using CMake to build Hercules-390,
    fails when run on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) using Regina Rexx.  
    Regina Rexx is the only REXX interpreter included in the 
    WSL repositories,
    just as it is in native Ubuntu repositories.  
</p>
<p>
    The Rexx Utilities package included with Regina Rexx is unable to
    identify directories in the WSL file system.  
    The runtest.rexx command uses the Rexx Utilities package to 
    check the validity of directory names included in 
    command line arguments provided to runtest.rexx.  
    Oddly, the Regina Rexx Utilities package has no difficulty 
    returning a valid list of files in a directory of the 
    WSL file system.  
</p>
<p>
    To use <code>make test</code> on WSL,
    you will need to build Open Object Rexx (ooRexx) from source.  
    The current stable production version of ooRexx has been tested.
</p>

<h4 id="oorexx">Open Object Rexx and Hercules</h4>
<p>The issue previously noted on this page regarding the use of
Open Object Rexx 4.2.0 and Hercules has been addressed in commit
<a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/hyperion/commit/cd05efad3d2205c131330b1ef01103f8c952d482" target="_blank">cd05efa</a>.
CMake may be used to build Hercules integrated with Open Object Rexx without error.
</p>
<del><p>The current release of Open Object Rexx, 4.2.0,
fails when integrated with Hercules built using CMake
on Leap 42.2 and Ubuntu 16.04.
The failure has been reproduced using a simple c program that
dynamically loads the shared ooRexx libraries and attempts
to run a sample REXX script script based on the example on
page <nobr>376-377</nobr> of the
<a href="http://hercdoc.glanzmann.org/V400/HerculesUserReference.pdf" target="_blank">
Hercules User Reference</a>.
</p>
<p>Open Object Rexx integrates without issue to Hercules
when built with autotools.
The ooRexx 5.0.0 beta as of August 2017 can be used to
run the simple c program without error.
The beta version operates without issue when integrated
with Hercules build using CMake.
</p>
<p>One might speculate that ooRexx 4.2.0 has an issue
when called dynamically from programs that are not built to use
libtool.
Further research would be needed to verify this,
specifically building the small c program using libtool.
</p>
<p>The alternatives for this issue are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the 5.0.0 beta version of Open Object Rexx.</li>
<li>Use Regina Rexx as the REXX interpreter integrated with Hercules.</li>
</ul>
</del>
